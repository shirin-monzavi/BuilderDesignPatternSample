## Builder Pattern in C#

### 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates the Builder Pattern implemented in a C# Console Application. The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a step-by-step approach to constructing complex objects. It allows for more readable, maintainable, and flexible object creation, separating the construction logic from the actual object representation.

### 🎯 Usage

This project presents how to use the Builder Pattern by creating objects step by step. The example includes:

✅ A Product class representing the complex object (Computer).

✅ A Builder class that constructs the object in a structured manner (ComputerBuilder).

✅ A Director class that manages the construction process (ComputerShop).

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
