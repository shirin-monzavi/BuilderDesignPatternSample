## Builder Pattern in C#


### 📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates the Builder Pattern implemented in a C# Console Application. The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a step-by-step approach to constructing complex objects. It allows for more readable, maintainable, and flexible object creation, separating the construction logic from the actual object representation.

### ✨ Features
