Builder Pattern in C#

#H1 Overview:

This repository demonstrates the Builder Pattern implemented in a C# Console Application. The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a step-by-step approach to constructing complex objects. It allows for more readable, maintainable, and flexible object creation, separating the construction logic from the actual object representation.

#H1 Features:

Implements the Builder Pattern in C#.

Demonstrates step-by-step object construction.

Provides a real-world example to facilitate understanding.

#H1 Technologies Used:

C#

.NET Framework 8.0

#H1 Usage:

This project presents how to use the Builder Pattern by creating objects step by step. The example includes:

A Product class representing the complex object (Computer).

A Builder class that constructs the object in a structured manner (ComputerBuilder).

A Director class that manages the construction process (ComputerShop).
